# Cook Book - Recipe Finder
A recipe finder app using the [Edamam Recipes API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api). It allows the user to input a key work (such as chicken) and a meal type (such as dinner) and will show the user 20 recipes for that search. The app also allows for the user to favorite a specific recipe (and also unfavorite).

This app uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
